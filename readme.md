# :wrench: .files

[![GuardRails badge](https://badges.production.guardrails.io/shtakai/dotfiles.svg)](https://www.guardrails.io)

_This is a **snapshot** my ([**@bookercodes**](https://twitter.com/bookercodes)) dot files. Whilst there is an
[`install.sh`](https://github.com/alexbooker/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh) script, it's really intended for my own
use - you probably won't have much success with it - you would probably be better off reading the individual dot files and
copying the bits that interest you._
